####Week 1 Project at Makers Academy!

####SYNOPSIS

In a team, recreate London Boris Bikes system, by using TDD

####MY APPROACH

####TECHNOLOGIES:

- *Ruby*

- *Rspec*

#####PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS:

- *Test driven development (TDD)*

- *Object Oriented Design (OOD)*

- *Object Oriented Programming (OOP)*

- *Pair programming*

####HOW TO RUN

type in your terminal/commandline

```
rspec

```

####CODE SNIPPET

Example of the Bike class

```ruby
class Bike
  attr_reader :broken

  def initialize
    fix!
  end

  def break!
    @broken = true
  end

  def fix!
    @broken = false
  end
end

```

####WHAT I'VE LEARNT

I've started understand better what is OOP, and how close software to reality. That to solve problems by writing code 
developer needs to think of real life patters.
